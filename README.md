# Neural-Network-in-Python-from-Scratch
This repository hosts a neural network constructed solely with Python and numpy, emphasizing foundational understanding and operational transparency. Ready to run 'out-of-the-box,' it uses Keras only for dataset loading, maintaining independence in core functionalities. Community contributions for further development are encouraged.
